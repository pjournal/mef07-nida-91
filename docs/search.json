I work as an Indirect Online Channels Account Manager in Turkish Airlines. In my field, there is big bulk of data that requires presentation, visualisation and interpretation, which surely will bring up more sophisticated insight via deeper analysis. I aim to enrich these skills and put them in practice by making use of various tools and approaches learnt during this course."

In this video, he presents the useful extensions of R, Python and Shiny functions for their use in Tableau. He starts with an example of implementing a machine learning model, random forest, via extensions from R and Python, but then explains that Python and R extensions might be useful not only for ML models, and also for more advanced statistical computations that Tableau is not capable of. All these extensions are possible by installing specific Tableau API packages in R and Python, and integrating them to Tableau with the extension paths created in R Studio. At the end of the video, he also presents how to provide Shiny extension. Its use is simpler, just a file version is downloaded to then be uploaded to Tableau app that is being used. At the end of the video, he illustrates an example of how the graphs created with four different tools can be displayed together in a Tableau dashboard.\nIn order to check for further resources, these extension names are:\n\nplumbertableau for R\nfastapitableau for Python\nshinytableau for Shiny"
