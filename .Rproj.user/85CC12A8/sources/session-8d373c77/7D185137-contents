[Youtube Shiny App](https://nidad.shinyapps.io/Shiny/)

In this Shiny app, there are three visualisations of my selected Youtube dataset:

-   Tab 1:

    **Plot 1 (Total View of Countries):** Summarises the total view of selected countries during the whole time range of the data

    **Plot 2 (Total View of Channels):** Summarises the total view of selected channels in selected countries during the whole time range of the data

-   Tab 2:

    **Plot 1 (View Trend of Channels Throughout the Date Range)**: Summarises the view trend of selected channels in selected countries for the selected date range.
