In this in-class assignment, we visualise the comparison of two different variables of our proposed datasets in Assignment 1 via a scatterplot using "ggplot2" package.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
##reimport the dataset
youtube <- read.csv("/Users/nidadonmez/Downloads/trending_yt_videos_113_countries.csv") 
```
I would like to check for any relationship between the comment engagement and the like engagement in terms of views in a scatterplot:

```{r}
## summarise the data first to see how each variable looks
c_l_by_country <- youtube %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
summarise(c_engagement = sum(comment_count)/sum(view_count), l_engagement = sum(like_count)/sum(view_count))
c_l_by_country
```
The comment engagement rate by country can vary in terms of decimels while like engagement is in general point two decimels. In this case, it can be difficult to summarise y values around proper numbers, but we can try:

```{r}
##a scatterplot as below can be created. 
ggplot(c_l_by_country, aes(x = c_engagement, y = l_engagement)) + geom_point() + expand_limits(y=0) + expand_limits(x=0)
##expand_limits equaled to 0 to start each row by 0 to see clearly

```

Comment rate looked very varied having values less than e-4 and e-3 on the initial rows of data, making us think that it might also include values of until e-1 decimels. However, in the summary of the scatterplot, we can see that it is proper data in between 0 to 0.003. In this case, the scatterplot brought us a clear summary where we can see a positive correlation between the comment engagement and the like engagement.
