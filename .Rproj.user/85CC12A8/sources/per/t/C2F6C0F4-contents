In this in-class assignment, we run three simple analyses  using dplyr package on our proposed datasets in Assignment 1. My dataset was **"Daily Trending Youtube Videos"**.

## | Preparation

```{r} 
## Installing dplyr
library(dplyr)
```


```{r} 
## Importing the dataset
youtube <- read.csv("/Users/nidadonmez/Downloads/trending_yt_videos_113_countries.csv") 
```

## | Analysis 1
Here I check the validity of the dataset by grouping the total number of records by country and filter them by randomly selected dates:

```{r} 
## To check if each country on a given date really contains 50 videos:
youtube %>%
    filter(snapshot_date == "2023-11-10") %>% 
 group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(total_count =n(), .groups = "drop")
```
```{r}
## To continue above analysis with another random date:
youtube %>%
    filter(snapshot_date == "2023-11-05") %>% 
 group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(total_count =n(), .groups = "drop")

```

## | Analysis 2

I want to bring the top 5 videos that have got the highest number of comments worldwide during the time range of the dataset:


```{r}
youtube  %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
summarise(total_comment = sum(comment_count)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_comment)) %>% 
head(5)
```

## | Analysis 3

To check the engagement rates by country, I want to group the countries by the highest rate of likes out of total views during the time range of the dataset, and bring top 10 countries:


```{r}
youtube  %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
summarise(total_view = sum(view_count), like_engagement = sum(like_count)/sum(view_count)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  arrange(desc(like_engagement)) %>% 
head(10)
```
And bring last 10 countries for lowest engagement rates:

```{r}
youtube  %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
summarise(total_view = sum(view_count), like_engagement = sum(like_count)/sum(view_count)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  arrange(like_engagement) %>% 
head(10)
```
